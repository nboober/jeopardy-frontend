# Jeopardy Front-End

## Introduction
This is my FlatIron Mod 4 project. This project was our interpretation of the game Jeopardy.

## How To Play
 - Sign into game with either:
    - username: "nick" , password: "password"
    - username: "will" , password: "password"
 - Answer 15 trivia questions. Once they are all answered the player is given a final score.
 - If the user's final score is higher than the previous 3 highest scores in the users profile, than it will be saved to the user's profile page. 

## Install 
 - Fork and clone this repository
    - You will also need to fork and clone the backend for the database (jeopardy-backend)
    - The backend will need to be run before this repository in order for the game to work properly
 - npm install
 - npm start
